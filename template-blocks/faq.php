       <input type="checkbox" id="title2">
       <p class="contentBox2">Unlimited hosting and maintenance are included in your one-time payment of £125+VAT. You are also able to connect a domain you already own at no additional cost. We offer custom domain names, professional email addresses, and enhanced online marketing on our Basic, Plus, or Reputation plans, which are always available to you on a monthly or annual basis. There is no obligation to upgrade to one of these plans at any time, but we know some business owners value the additional service.</p>

       <p class="contentBox3">
        The first step is to pay the lifetime fee £125+VAT. This is a one-time payment for us to start working on your website. Once that is paid for, you will be asked to answer a few questions and send us materials (logos, images and videos) related to your business, so that we can custom make your website for you. After that, all you need to do is wait one week for your website to be ready.
